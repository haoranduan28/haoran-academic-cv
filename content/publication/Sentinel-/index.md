abstract: With increasing concerns over data privacy and model copyrights, especially in the context of collaborations between AI service providers and data owners, an innovative SG-ZSL paradigm is proposed in this work. SG-ZSL is designed to foster efficient collaboration without the need to exchange models or sensitive data. It consists of a teacher model, a student model and a generator that links both model entities. The teacher model serves as a sentinel on behalf of the data owner, replacing real data, to guide the student model at the AI service provider's end during training. Considering the disparity of knowledge space between the teacher and student, we introduce two variants of the teacher model the omniscient and the quasi-omniscient teachers. Under these teachers' guidance, the student model seeks to match the teacher model's performance and explores domains that the teacher has not covered. To trade off between privacy and performance, we further introduce two distinct security-level training protocolsï¼š white-box and black-box, enhancing the paradigm's adaptability. Despite the inherent challenges of real data absence in the SG-ZSL paradigm, it consistently outperforms in ZSL and GZSL tasks, notably in the white-box protocol. Our comprehensive evaluation further attests to its robustness and efficiency across various setups, including stringent black-box training protocol.
